## Challenges you faced and how you overcame them

I initially had a few misconceptions about Firebase Functions, likely because I hadn't used them before. 
However, after implementing them in the project, I found the experience quite challenging and enjoyable.
I overcame the challenge by googling, reading documentations and little bit of chat gpt.


## Additional done

- Authentication for identifying who placed the order (Google sign in with Firebase)


## Can be done for better User Experience

- Code generators can be used for repetitive tasks like handing json responses, models etc (Dev POV)
- Support float/double value for ratings (1.5, 2.5, 3.5...)
- Add product quantity field as user can change quantity of product while making purchase
- Use shimmer loaders
